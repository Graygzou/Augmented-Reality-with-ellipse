# Augmented Reality with ellipse
Detect and estimate parameters of an ellipse to fill it with custom images. This project was made during a
course, followed at [ENSEEIHT](http://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/index.html), a french engineer school.

## Getting Started
To be able to run the basic estimation run the following scripts in order :
1. `donnees.m` which generate random points. they will be used as initial data to estimate ellipses.
2. `exerciceX.m` a specific method of estimation that will print an ellipse from the initial points.

If you want to play the augmented reality application, just follow those steps :
1. Run the `augmentation.m` script.
1. Run the `cinema.m` script.

## About
Different regression models were used to estimate ellipse's parameters.

Each techniques are studied to understand their weaknesses and strengths.

All scripts are written in Matlab and comments are in french.
