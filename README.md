# Augmented Reality with ellipse
Detect and estimate parameters of an ellipse to fill it with custom images. This project was made during a
course, followed at [ENSEEIHT](http://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/index.html), a french engineer school.

From left to right : Initial image containing an ellipse (the black and white target). Once we've detect it, we fill it with the a flame image shown in the middle image. The last image represents the final result obtained.

## Getting Started
To be able to run the basic estimation run the following scripts in order :
1. `donnees.m` which generate points from an ellipse with added noise. They will be used as initial data through each estimation method.
2. `exerciceX.m` with a `X` a number which executes a specific estimation. It will print the estimated ellipse on top of the initial points.

If you want to play the augmented reality application, just follow those steps :
1. Run the `augmentation.m` script which compute `n` augmented images from two initial sets of images (basics one and those integrated). This script might take some of time to finish.
1. Run the `cinema.m` script which show all the `n` augmented images one after the other like a flipping book.

## About
Different regression models were used to estimate ellipse's parameters.

Each techniques are studied to understand their weaknesses and strengths.

All scripts are written in Matlab and comments are in french.
